         <h2>VR is making medical training cheaper, better, and more accessible than ever</h2>

            When Dr. Eric Bing started working at Dallas’ Southern Methodist University (SMU), the person in the office next to his would give him a new perspective on how virtual reality can be instrumental in teaching medical students.
         </p>   
         <p>SMU happens to have one of the world’s best graduate schools for video game design and Bing’s office neighbor, Professor Anthony Cuevas, helps create the curriculum for it. Surgery and first person shooters may seem worlds apart, but over the course of several months, the professors’ neighborly chitchat gave rise to a low-cost VR training system that can be implemented in locations where medical schools are limited, such as sub-saharan Africa.</p>
         <p>In order to meet the basic need of surgical care in the developing world by 2030, the surgical workforce there would need to double, according to the Lancet Commission of Global Surgery. Shafi Ahmed, co-founder of the VR health training platform Medical Realities, has highlighted this problem as one he hopes his company’s content can address. Dr. Alex Young of the startup VR company Virti is developing a platform that gives students access to training programs for free, with an eye toward improving medical care in the third world.

        </p>
        <p>“We’ve always been trying to think through “How do we scale up the number of surgeons who do these procedures or any surgical procedures?” explains Bing. “There are just not enough surgeons in developing countries to provide the care that people need.” Many sub-saharan African countries, for example, have no medical schools or just one.

            Bing and Cuevas brainstormed the potential for training students in virtual reality.. While diagnostic and surgical simulations are now a regular part of many American medical school programs, they’re much harder to find in the developing world given the associated costs, which can quickly rise into six figures</p>
            <p>
                When the doctor running the med program at the University of Zambia teaching hospital stopped by SMU to pick up an honorary degree, Bing got him together with Cuevas to figure how to create a VR program.

Along with doctors and professors from the University of North Carolina, King’s College London and SMU, the three created a study on teaching oncology with low-cost virtual reality headsets. Around that time, the price of Oculus Quest had recently dropped, making the budget for VR instruction feasible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using SMU’s VR program, numerous medical students at the University of Zambia have practiced the steps for performing a radical abdominal hysterectomy, needing to complete it within a target time and accuracy rate. The simulation’s operating room is outfitted with equipment commonly found in Zambia. Studying the VR surgical program, the dev team found users need to reflect on what they’re learning to retain information. As a result, no student can attempt the virtual procedure more than six times in one day.
