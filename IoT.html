         <h2>How IoT Can Make Your Home Safer and More Secure
        </h2>   
        <p>
            Back in 2017, Gartner predicted that by 2020, IoT technology would be in 95% of electronic product designs.
             It’s now relatively inexpensive to add Internet of Things (IoT) features to a product,
              and this has helped to make it easier and more convenient to keep your home safe from a variety of potential dangers.

        </p>
        <p>
            However, according to Tom Snyder, executive director at RIoT, connected sensors have been securing homes long before IoT was a popularized term. 
            “Augmenting mechanical locks with electronic home security systems ushered in the era of connected sensors, tied to networks for alerting and response.
            And he said these systems collected data in real-time 
            (for example, the door has been opened) and created an immediate response (the alarm sounds and the security company alerts the homeowner).
            “That age old security system has been IoT all along,” Snyder said.

“But many more use cases exist today that add more sensors, richer data, 
lower latency and deeper analytics to provide significantly more security,” he explained.

And fortunately, it’s only going to get better. “As computing and communication technology increases in performance while reducing in power consumption, size and cost, 
the ability of home installed devices to perform highly complex tasks for us increases at an incredible rate,” said Mike Hibbett, security architect in the IoT
Here are just some of the ways IoT can make your home safer and more secure.

            Monitoring and Notification
        </h3>
        <p>The ability to monitor what’s happening in your home when you’re not there is one of the most significant
             ways that IoT provides not only security, but also peace of mind.
             “Devices such as alarm systems now have the intelligence to detect, through a camera, when a person comes within an area of interest, 
             and can differentiate between people walking along a public path or walking on your property,” explained Hibbett.

             And some security cameras have a facial recognition feature that can even distinguish between strangers and friends. 
             Whether you’re at home or out and about, you can actively receive notifications via your smartphone and even see who is at your door.

            Convenient Control
        </h3>
        <p>
            However, monitoring is only part of the picture. You can also take an active role in keeping your home secure. 
            For example, once you discover you left the garage door open, you can remotely close it.
            “IoT can selectively let certain people in and keep others out, even when no one is home,” Perry said. “That means letting your trusted deliveryman bring a box inside your house so no one steals it, but you don't have to leave your door unlocked all day.”

            If fact, with IoT locks, you can grant temporary access to visiting guests — or family members (like your kids who always lose their keys). 
            “These same systems can also log a door’s usage,
            reporting on when your front door was opened throughout the day and for how long,” said Chris Romeika, operations director of Pangea.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: 600;">
            Safety  
        </h3>
        <p>
            The vast majority of crimes are property crimes, and the front door is the most common point of entry for burglars, followed by a first-floor window, and the back door.

“Smart IoT-equipped security systems can enable 24/7 observation of a home by connecting alarm and camera applications to your mobile device,” said Romeika. “According to the FBI, 65% of burglaries in the US take place during the day—so being able to check up on the house while you’re at work, out shopping, or away on holiday is a game changer,” he explained.

Unfortunately, most residential burglaries are not solved because there’s no evidence and no witnesses. “However, homeowners can watch and record the video feed, and this could prove invaluable when investigating any event,” said cybersecurity expert Greg Scott, author of “Bullseye Breach: The Anatomy of an Electronic Break-In.”
 In fact, Snyder said that video recordings are used by the police in many municipalities to help solve neighborhood crime.
