         <h2>Job Role: AI Strategist </h2>
         <img src="">
         <p>What is an AI strategist? It's an interesting question,
             particularly in the context of how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the business world and revolutionizing how companies sell products and services.
             Here's some of what we've heard "on the street" from tech experts and industry professionals close to AI design.</p>

         <h2>A Glorified Product/Project Manager?  </h2>
         <p>In some ways, an AI strategist is a lot like other roles that follow a particular process from beginning to end, 
             from cradle to grave, or more accurately — from prototype to reality. But that comparison is only skin deep.  
             “An AI strategist can be similar to a project manager role, 
             in that the AI strategist also needs to oversee AI projects to ensure they are executed as smoothly as possible, 
            that the projects keep in line with the business goals,
             and to ensure the right talent and tech set up is in place for AI projects to be successful,” said Rebecca Merrett,
              a Data Science Instructor at Data Science Dojo who spoke to us about what’s involved in this AI role. </p>

         <h2>Communicate Value and Requirements</h2>
         <p> In a 2018 Medium article titled “The Need for an AI Strategist”, author Ravi Vayuvegula goes over some of the reasons that these specialists are so valuable, partially based on how the average business leadership team lacks the expertise to fully grasp the realities of AI.

            “(The disconnect in understanding AI) stems from the top management being unclear about the value AI brings to the table,” Vayuvegula wrote. “In spite of their enthusiasm for AI implementation the CIO/CTOs are unable to communicate the economic value add of AI transformation to the rest of the management team … Bridging this gap is exactly the job of an AI strategist.”
            
            Vayuvegula also touched on some pretty interesting statistics. For example, the assertion that “data related challenges hinder 96% of organizations from achieving artificial intelligence” or that “organizations invest in an average of seven different machine learning (ML) tools.” (Read Job Role: Machine Learning Engineer.)
            
            These statistics and the ensuing narrative really paint a picture of why AI strategy is important. If you can't communicate the economic value, you can't target the project. If you don't know what the requirements are, you're likely to land in hot water when trying for implementation.
            
            Vayuvegula suggested an AI strategist should have three core competencies:
            
           1. A significant understanding of the AI business domain.
           2. A grasp of ML fundamentals and familiarity with algorithm work.
           3. The ability to separate fact from fiction in artificial intelligence development.
