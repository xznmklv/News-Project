            <h2>Drones in 2020: What's Next?</h2>
            <img src="">
            <p>
                Drones, also known as unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or remote-control flying robots, have evolved from recreational novelties to business essentials.
                 With capabilities that range from delivery to surveillance, along with unprecedented levels of efficiency, the growth of commercial drones is inevitable. 
                 At the same time, the safe and secure operation (or lack, thereof) of both commercial and recreational drones is a valid concern.
                These are some of the drone trends you can expect to see in 2020.  
            </p>
            <h2>Drones and Drugs</h2>
            <p>The pharmaceutical industry is poised to take advantage of drone delivery services. 
                “This is the year of major leaps in social acceptance of drone delivery, for at least prescription drugs and minor purchases from certain retail pharmacies and stores,” said Taqee Khaled, director of strategy at Nerdery.

                He also expects to see drone “bundles” piloted between leading pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens. 
                “I imagine some of the big pharma companies are already proposing drone exclusive delivery for certain very high cost and/or life-saving drugs as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In September, 2019, Walgreens announced a pilot program with Alphabet’s Wings to deliver over-the-counter meds.
                 In October, 2019, CVS Pharmacy and AmerisourceBergen announced agreements with UPS to deliver pharmaceuticals using drones.
                  Khaled believes that these partnership announcements are major endorsements of the use of drone technology.

                    “At the same time, no drone advancements will be made at full scale — we’ll only see continued test markets in 2020,” Khaled said.
                And since this process is still being developed, he warns that there will be several accidents and incorrect deliveries.   
            </p>
            <h2>Other Industries Benefitting from Drones</h2>
            <p>However, the pharmaceutical industry isn’t the only sector using drones. 
                According to Jason Braverman, CTO at SkyX, the main verticals being serviced by commercial drones are agriculture, construction, exploration and GIS mapping. 
                “As we push to 2020, verticals like midstream oil & gas (pipelines), 
                rail and border surveillance will benefit greatly from implementing commercial drones into their monitoring ecosystem,” he said. 
                “These verticals are currently going through a widespread digital transformation, and precise high-quality visual data coming from drones is giving these organizations the ability to see things like never before.”

                Companies like PINC make warehouse drones that can digitally check inventory, and this type of automated cycle counting will only increase in 2020. 
                These robots are not only accurate and fast, but also navigate the hard-to-reach areas that are potentially dangerous to human workers.

                “Drone detection systems will likely become a standard and best practice for critical infrastructure,
                large gathering areas, correctional facilities, and other high risk assets,” said John Bekisz, Jr., owner and operator at UAS Vues. 
            </p>
            <h2>Emergence and Growth of Companies — and Individuals</h2>
            <p>You can also expect a lot of movement behind the scenes. “Recently introduced legislation in Congress would end grants for drones manufactured in countries — cough, China — where data leaks would damage national security,” said Lt. Col. Jeremy Latchaw, founder of Macatawa Unmanned Systems. And he believes this will open the door for American companies. “For example, Skydio already has the drone world wondering if it will cut into significant market share with its Skydio 2.”

                Another trend Latchaw predicts: mergers and acquisitions among startups in the drone space.
                
                “Some of the larger firms have already started; for example, Aerodyne Group recently bought the drone services of Measure.”</p>
