            <h2>Justice Department charges 4 Chinese Army spies over massive 2017 Equifax hack</h2><br>

                The United States Department of Justice has charged four Chinese intelligence officers with hacking-related offenses in relation to the September 2017 breach of credit reporting agency Equifax that affected nearly 150 million Americans and many foreign citizens. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said during a press conference that the hackers are also charged with “stealing the sensitive personal information of nearly half of all American citizens.”

                Barr called it a “a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people.” He went on to say that Chinese hackers have a “voracious appetite” for personal data on Americans.
                Barr also said that though it is not standard procedure for the U.S. Department of Justice to charge foreign military and intelligence officials, the Equifax breach warranted it due to its massive impact. The crime “cannot be countenanced,” he said.

                Federal prosecutors filed the nine-count indictment of the four People’s Liberation Army members – Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei — in Atlanta. Prosecutors allege the four stole company trade secrets. Their other alleged crimes include computer fraud, economic espionage, and wire fraud. 

FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said the law enforcement agency could not actually take the four into custody for prosecution and possible sentencing should they be found guilty but noted: “One day, these criminals will slip up, and when they do, we’ll be there.”
