            <h2>Top AI Use Cases: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="newsimg\image3.jpg" width="300px" height="500px">
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been instrumental in revolutionizing nearly all industry sectors, 
                but specifically in healthcare—there's a noticeable impact being felt around the world. Real-world AI use cases show AI and ML are essential for many, 
                if not all, healthcare organizations' future.
              <h2> AI Use Case #1: DynaLIFE and AltaML’s Colon Polyp Project to Begin Pathology Digitalization </h2> <br>
              <p>
The digitization of pathology  is seeing massive improvements to applications for diagnostic healthcare with a breakthrough project focusing on colon polyp identification and analysis.
 Patients and industry pros will experience greater efficiency and scalability in the laboratory environment, plus better patient outcomes.
 While efficiency is a huge driver, digitization will also make the work of pathologists less difficult. Currently, colon tissue samples are biopsied by a gastroenterologist and then sent to the lab to be embedded in a paraffin block and sectioned to produce glass slides for interpretation by a pathologist.

            <h2>AI Use Case #2: Avoiding Unnecessary Surgery</h2><br>
            <p>It's not infrequent for patients to undergo surgeries which may later prove to be unnecessary. These unneeded procedures force people to face totally avoidable risks and burdensome surgical expenses.

                Health plans often include programs that help patients and their local healthcare teams make better informed decisions by educating them on the latest treatment options available. However, it’s hard to achieve adequate engagement in these programs, especially when patients are in a crisis situation already.
                
                ConsumerMedical developed a new program that leverages AI and predictive analytics to identify patients considering surgery, and evaluates whether these operations are actually necessary or if there are other alternatives with far less risk involved that would better help them in the long run. Earlier identification of people on the pathway to surgeries doubles the average program engagement rate and reduces unnecessary surgeries.</p>

                <h2>
                    AI Use Case #3: Diagnosing Infectious Diseases
                </h2>
                <p>Machine learning and big data may help change the way we diagnose infectious diseases forever. That’s the case of the technology implemented by Aperiomics, a biotech firm in the Washington, DC area that developed an AI-based method to analyze organic samples for diseases at an incredible speed.

                    Using “deep shotgun metagenomics”, Aperiomics is able to take any genomically sequenced organic sample and identify all 37,000 known and sequenced pathogens. Using a proprietary database and ML algorithms, they are able to relatively quickly run standard genetic samples through their system and create a comprehensive profile of everything in the sample, identifying what should and should not be there and in what quantities they were found.
                    
                    This work, which would be impossible without the power of ML and AI, means that patients who have difficult to diagnose infectious diseases are finally able to get a diagnosis and treatment.
                    
                    This technology has been used by sufferers of chronic urinary tract infections and to detect potentially lethal cases of blood sepsis, severe gastrointestinal infections and more.</p>
