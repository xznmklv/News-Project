            Encryption Vs. Law Enforcement (And How It Affects Your Privacy Rights)
         </h2>

            Encryption is the best way to keep your private information private. And it’s not a new concept. 
            According to Chris Parker, founder of WhatIsMyIPAddress.com, manual encryption has always been an option.
            “Anyone can write in code to conceal what they're saying, and share that code with someone else if desired.” 
            But in the digital era, encryption has taken on a new meaning, since you don’t have to create your own code.
         </p>
         <h2>
            Benefits of Encryption
         </h2>
         <p>
            Technology has made it incredibly easy to create data, but also easy for that data to be hijacked. 
            “Encryption protects data at rest when stored on hard drives, cell phone
             or in the cloud, and it can also protect data in transit as it moves from one device to another,” 
             explained Cindy Murphy, president of digital forensics at Tetra Defense.
         </p>
         <p>
            “In these situations, encryption acts to protect the data, including personally
             identifying information, health information and financial information from being improperly used if intercepted,” she said.

             There’s a growing cybersecurity war on the healthcare industry, and the finance and energy sectors are always popular with bad actors. 
            However, just as IoT devices can compromise homes
            industrial IoT devices have increased the risk of cyberattacks in the manufacturing industry, according to Vectra. 
            In fact, no sector is really safe from cybercriminals. 
         </p>
         <h2>
            Why Encryption is Problematic for Law Enforcement
         </h2>
         <p>
            Keeping your data private is a good idea — until it’s not. 
            Cotten is a high-profile example of the latter. However, encryption in general has created a tug of war regarding who has the right to decrypt data.

            According to Jeff MacMillan, CEO and founder of KeyNexus: "The problem is that the various parties view this issue from their particular perspectives and goals.”
            
            Government agencies are not interested in the average citizen’s private data itself;
             they are simply driven and focused on solving crimes, tracking national security threats and keeping their communities safe.”
         </p>
         <p>
            “Encryption frequently blocks law enforcement, 
            at both local and national levels, from accessing data that could be useful in their investigations or even prevent potential crimes from occurring.”
         </p>
         <p>
            For example: He said they may want to access a messaging app to see the history of a suspect’s conversation — information that could save someone’s life or prevent a crime.
             “The majority of these messaging apps often use end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning that only the senders and recipients have access to the data, not any mediators, including the host company,” Deslatte said.

            That’s why service-level encryption offerings—like WhatsApp by Facebook—contribute to the controversy. 
            “The company has been pressured to install a security backdoor to allow governments to read messages if considered necessary, but so far Facebook has refused,” Parker explained.
