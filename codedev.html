            <h2>
                How Low-Code Development Will Bring Data Science to the Masses
            </h2>
            <p>
                Data science is becoming a must-have for the new digital economy. As organizations become more adept at capturing, storing and analyzing data from numerous sources, 
                they are finding previously untapped founts of knowledge that lead to new sales opportunities, new markets and even entirely new business models.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge, however, is that only the most well-heeled enterprise has the means to acquire the highly specialized skillsets needed to turn data into actionable information.
                 Demand is high for what is usually a PH.D-level employee, and viable candidates are scarce.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Low Code to the Rescue
            </h2>
            <p>
                Enter low-code development. As Alluxio CEO Steven Mih points out, low-code, and even no-code, tools are hitting the channel that should allow even non-technical knowledge works to query databases,
                 mash up disparate data sets and derive insights from random information — all without having to learn the intricacies of coding, DB management or any other data science-related skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this world, business teams become the experts in leveraging data for their own needs rather than rely upon a mystical cabal of scientists who have limited knowledge and intuition when it comes to business matters.

                As early as 2020, Mih says “these no-code or low-code technologies will bring machine learning to the forefront and make services smarter so the business isn’t reliant on individuals with specific expertise. 
                Instead of building and deploying models, for instance, we will see ‘bring your own model and we’ll run the training on it for you’ autonomous technology.”
            </p>
            <h2>Coding for the People</h2>
            <p>
                All of this activity falls under the broader goal of democratizing data science throughout the knowledge workforce, according to business services firm Deloitte.
                 With the U.S. alone is looking at a shortfall of some 250,000 data scientists by 2024, low/no-code, along with other developments like automated machine learning, AI pre-training, 
                self-service analytics and accelerated learning, aims to break the bottleneck of data science skills that is currently holding many companies back.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be sure, there will always be a need for highly specialized data scientists, but with more usable tools in the hands of more people, those highly paid employees can be tasked with projects more suited to their talents.

The key to successfully implementing low/no-code tools into enterprise workflows is to make them as easy as possible to use. Simplified GUIs with drag and drop modules, along with an overall user-friendly design and architecture, will go a long way toward accelerating adoption.
