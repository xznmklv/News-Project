         <h2>Business Intelligence: How BI Can Improve Your Company's Processes</h2>
         <p>For something so vital to the long-term success of a modern business, the concept of business intelligence (BI) isn't well defined.
              But that doesn't stop many companies from wanting it, even if they don't entirely understand it.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What is Business Intelligence?
          </h2>    
          <p>Business intelligence refers to the collection and analysis of data in order to produce insights that will improve a companyâ€™s processes. 
              There's a lot packed into that definition and, as a result, a lot of the confusion around BI stems from the assumption that it stops with analysis.</p>
           <h2>
            The 4 Major Criteria of Business Intelligence</h2>
           <p> Although the distinction gets muddy sometimes, BI can be thought of as the end goal of business analytics because it produces the actionable insights a business needs to make informed decisions.
            
            In order to do this, effective business intelligence needs to meet four major criteria.
             </p>
             <h3 style="font-weight: 600;">Accuracy of the data inputs and outputs</h3>
             <p>This refers to the accuracy of the data inputs as well as outputs. The two are, of course, related. Any system that requires analysis can fall prey to the garbage in,
                  garbage out (GIGO) problem, in which tainted data can ruin results, even when the analytical model is sound.</p>
                <p> In order to get accurate answers (output), the data going in must be accurate and relevant to the questions the business is seeking to answer.

                  It's often impractical to try to dump all the data produced by a company into an analytical model and expect it to make sense of everything from production numbers to employees' marital status. This is why human discretion is often used to select the data that is relevant to a particular problem.
                  
                  That said, this selection can be over-exercised or simply done wrong, bringing us back to the GIGO problem.
             </p>  
             <h3 style="font-weight: 600;">Valuable Insight</h3>  
             <p>Not all insights are valuable. Knowing the handedness (left or right) of the majority of your customers may be useful for a baseball glove manufacturer, but would be of less use to a shoe manufacturer. 
                 Although crunching all the data to find out something that was previously unknown can be satisfying, BI should offer concrete insights.</p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: 600;">Timeliness</h3>  
              <p>
                Getting accurate and valuable insight is only half the battle. BI must also be able to deliver those insights at the right time. If that sports store we mentioned before only discovers the glove and running shoe correlation in December rather than at the start of the buying trend, it may lose the opportunity to capitalize on that information.

                There are two parts to timeliness:
                
                1.Timeliness of the data going in.
                2.Timeliness of the insights coming out.
                Businesses have different decision time frames depending on what they do. A retail outlet will likely want to be feeding very timely sales information into BI with the hope of getting timely insights to be implemented on a monthly, weekly or even daily basis
