            <h2>How Will AI Change the Market Research Scenario?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing many sectors. A whopping 80% of researchers think that AI is going to have a positive impact on the market, 
                so it’s a natural consequence to assume that this vertical is going to be revolutionized, as well.
                But how is this technology currently implemented in market research? What are the future developments which may have a major impact?
            </p>
            <h2>Detecting Fake News</h2>
            <p>Fake news and false claims (such as low-quality or data-less surveys or researches) can severely hamper the quality of market research.
                 Sample buyers require their data to be as clean and accurate as possible, 
                with non-misleading indicators that determine the precision of their survey and if any adjustment must be applied.
                Frauds are aplenty, with countless mobile click farms working to generate fake likes and pageviews, or install farms that create false app inventories. 
                With a yearly ad spending capping $5.7 billion USD just in the mobile app sector, 
                even just a mere 5% fraudulent install rate can cost mobile marketers nearly $300 million USD 
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding the Community</h2>
            <p>Behavioral predictions can help maintain good relationships with a company’s community, ensure customers’ loyalty, and avoid members disengagement to reduce churn.
                 Understanding the community can also help AI make significant market decisions, such as using
                 Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the best influencers that can "talk” the same language spoken by customers,
                  and find those who can really affect their choices.   
            </P>
            <P>A lot of critical marketing information comes in the form of human-spoken, unstructured text. 
                When customers are asked their feedback on something in the form of a customer survey, 
                an open-ended question that allows them to explain their opinions is much more useful than a plain number in a multiple-choices question.      
            </p>
            <h2> Dig Deeper into Unstructured Customer Data</h2>
            <p>The immense goldmine of information contained in unstructured marketing data is yet untapped. A delicious fruit ripe for the picking, the massive volume of business intelligence (BI) data produced every day by millions of users and companies can be used to feed the AI with a lot of information.
                 And the more data is analyzed, the more precise the subsequent behavioral analyses and marketing forecasts are going to be.

                Quite literally, a new industry aimed at collecting and reselling user data is steadily growing inside the marketing industry.
                 Data scavengers are proliferating, with some organizations even buying large amounts of junk email that contain promo material. 
                 So, yeah, this is a fantastic scenario where robots are scavenging junk to feed other robots, which just as futuristic as you expect it to be.
