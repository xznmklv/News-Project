                Cisco combined its SD-WAN and security technologies, and it extended its Catalyst 9000 switches and its intent based networking from big wired networks to wireless networks and branch deployments.

                Cisco bought SD-WAN vendor Viptela for $610 million last year. Its new Cisco SD-WAN Security product combines Viptela’s technology with Meraki, Cisco’s cloud-managed IT service and wireless LAN product, plus Cisco security software.

                On the security side of things, Cisco’s SD-WAN now integrates Cisco’s application-aware enterprise firewall, URL filtering technologies, and intrusion prevention system using Talos for threat intelligence. And its vManage dashboard simplifies how to deploy Cisco’s cloud security technology called Umbrella.

                Jeff Reed, SVP of product management for Cisco’s security business group, hinted at this combined SD-WAN and security product earlier this year at the RSA Conference. In an interview with SDxCentral, he said the “SD-WAN transition and the integration of security into that” are top of mind for Cisco, and added that there are “a lot of really interesting things we are doing between Viptela and Meraki on the SD-WAN side and Umbrella in cloud security.”

                Cisco also partnered with Microsoft on its new offering so that its SD-WAN monitors in real-time all available paths to the Microsoft Office 365 cloud. Using Microsoft Office URLs, Cisco determines the user’s closest cloud, which it claims results in up to 40 percent faster performance.

                Both the networking and security capabilities can be purchased through a single license model and managed through a single interface. The SD-WAN Security and Microsoft Office 365 software will be available in the fourth quarter.

                Service providers and other partners can build new services on top of Cisco SD-WAN via open APIs. To this end, Cisco DevNet created new SD-WAN learning labs and sandboxes to help developers and network engineers.

                And finally, Cisco is offering two new integrated services routers (ISR) designed for small and large branch offices, and a new fixed-price, SD-WAN Quick Start service that gives customers access to SD-WAN remote implementation and knowledge transfer capabilities.
