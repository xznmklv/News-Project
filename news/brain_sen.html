                Meditation can be a great way to relax and focus…but it’s simply not that easy to just do.
                A new device that solves that is the Muse: Brain sensing headband…that trains your brain to meditate.  Recently I spoke with Muse Co-founder Ariel Garten about how the headband works and what it can do for users.

                Muse is a wearable brain sensing headband. It measures your brains activity using EEG (Electroencephalography) sensors. The app that comes with the device converts the EEG signals into audio feedback to the user via the built-in headphones. The headband helps you to reach a deep guided relaxation state by playing different sounds to you while you meditate.

                The Muse device itself is well designed. Its gentle and flexible. You can use it anywhere but it is noticeable so you may prefer to use it at home. You can use the devices built in speakers but its better to use your own bud style earphones. The battery will last about 5 hours. So, if you’re long sessions you will need to charge it frequently. Not the best battery life
