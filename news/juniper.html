                Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, 
				which are used by internet service providers (ISPs)
				to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Cisco routing provides intent-based networking for the WAN, LAN, and cloud.

                Routers connect computers and other devices to the Internet. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel. It connects your business to the world, protects information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others.

                A router helps you connect multiple devices to the Internet, and connect the devices to each other. Also, you can use routers to create local networks of devices. These local networks are useful if you want to share files among devices or allow employees to share software tools.

                If you don’t have routers, your business's data won’t get directed to the right place. For example, if you'd like to print a document, you need a router to help get that document to a printer—not to another computer or a scanner.

                A modem connects your business to Internet access via your internet service provider (ISP). A router, on the other hand, connects many devices in a network—including modems. With a router in place, modems and other devices can transfer data from one location to another.
                Routing is the ability to forward IP packets—a package of data with an Internet protocol (IP) address—from one network to another. The router's job is to connect the networks in your business and manage traffic within these networks. Routers typically have at least two network interface cards, or NICs, that allow the router to connect to other networks.
