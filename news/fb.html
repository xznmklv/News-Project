                A database containing more than 267 million Facebook user IDs, phone numbers,
                 and names was left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password
                  or any other authentication.</p>

            <p>   Comparitech partnered with security researcher Bob Diachenko to uncover the Elasticsearch
                 cluster. Diachenko believes the trove of data is most likely the result of an illegal 
                 scraping operation or Facebook API abuse by criminals in Vietnam, according to the evidence.
            </p>
                The information contained in the database could be used to conduct large-scale SMS spam 
                and phishing campaigns, among other threats to end users.
            <p>
                Diachenko immediately notified the internet service provider managing the IP address of
                 the server so that access could be removed. However, Diachenko says the data was also 
                 posted to a hacker forum as a download
