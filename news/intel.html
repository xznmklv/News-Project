                With more devices with 10th Gen Intel Processors on board hitting the market, Intel is now looking forward to the next generation of mobile PC processors, code named Tiger Lake.

                This week at CES in Las Vegas I was able to preview the power of Tiger Lake in action and get a better idea of what it will bring to the next generation of thin and light notebook devices.  I also caught up with one of of Intel’s experts to chat about Tiger Lake.  Listen below then view the promotional video from Intel.

                Intel has done a great job of keeping us waiting on big advancements to its processor architecture, but Tiger Lake could start to change that. The first generation of 10nm Core processors was effectively a no-show, and the second generation of 10nm with Intel Ice Lake processors only recently hit Ultrabooks, but stands out as more of an efficient alternative to the high performance Comet Lake processors that still come on Intel’s undying 14nm architecture.

                But at CES 2020, Intel gave plenty of attention to its upcoming Tiger Lake processors, so it's time to start getting ready for the next generation of mobile processors. Especially because Intel will have its competition cut out for it with AMD Ryzen 4000 mobile processors, which verge on desktop performance.
