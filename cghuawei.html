            It will include free voice services but focus on data, online payment and other services, he said.
            
            After starting out selling noodles in India and later across Asia, his family-owned conglomerate now includes a bank, a telecommunications business- providing rural telephony – and dozens of resorts, including two in the Maldives in partnership with India’s Taj Group.

            Huawei would supply equipment worth about $100 million for the launch of 4G services, which could later be upgraded to 5G, said Chaudhary, 64, who is also a lawmaker.

            “Huawei has been working with the state-owned telecom company, and now they will be working with us,” he said adding Nepal would ensure that business considerations were paramount when deals were made with companies from neighboring countries.
