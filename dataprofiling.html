                What is Data Profiling & Why is it Important in Business Analytics?
            </h2>
            <img src="">
            <p>When it comes to the data that is intended to drive business decisions, you can't afford to just take it at face value.
                You have to be assured of its quality, and that process starts with data profiling 
                which is defined as the method of examining the data available in a data source and collecting statistics and information about that data.
                That forms the basis for assessing the data’s quality.
            </p>
            <h2> What is Data Profiling? </h2>
            <p>Data profiling is necessary for data warehousing, as well as business intelligence projects. 
                The profiling part of data profiling entails applying algorithms to the data sets in question to better understand its “qualitative characteristics,” explains Business Intelligence.
                The goal is “to discover metadata when it is not available and to validate metadata when it is available.“ That can alert you to metadata anomalies.   
            </p>
            <h2> Best Profiling Technique </h2>
            <p>A data analyst can profile data manually. However, given the huge amount of data that just about all organizations have to contend with,
                 it would be very time-consuming and difficult to manage without software-enabled automation.

                Data Source Consulting cites numerous benefits to the automated approach. 
                 is speed: manual data profiling takes between 3-5 hours for each attribute, whereas automated profiling can handle an attribute in under 30 minutes.
                
                Another is thoroughness: 
                “With a manual approach, generally only a subset of the attributes and the rows are tested; 
                with a data profiling tool, a thorough evaluation of the data can be performed.” 
                The automated approach also lends itself better to centralized information that can be more easily shared by teams.
