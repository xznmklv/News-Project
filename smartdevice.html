            <h2>Nest makes two-factor authentication mandatory for its smart home devices</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="newsimg\image24.jpg">
            <p>Google Nest is the latest smart home device to make it mandatory for people to set up two-factor authentication on their smart home devices. 

                Nest announced the updates in a blog post on Tuesday, February 11, which is appropriately Safer Internet Day. 
                
                People will start to receive a six-digit verification code via email, and you won’t be able to access your account without it. 
                Nest said the option is meant to reduce the chance of someone accessing your Nest account. </p>
                
             <p>
                “Two-factor authentication has long been available to all users as a way to prevent the wrong person from gaining access to your account,
                 even if they have your username and password. Starting this spring, we’re requiring all Nest users who have not enrolled in this option
                  or migrated to a Google account to take an extra step by verifying their identity via email,” wrote Cory Scott, 
                  the head of Security and Privacy at Google Nest, in the blog post. 
             </p>
             <p>
                Nest’s update goes the extra mile in making sure all of its users have two-factor authentication set up 
                since those that don’t won’t be able to get into their accounts. The update should force people to implement it into their smart home devices finally.
