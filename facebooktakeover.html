            <h2>Facebook’s Twitter account taken over by hacker group OurMine</h2>
            <p>Facebook’s Twitter account was briefly hacked Friday afternoon by prominent group OurMine.

                The tweet read, “Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security better than Twitter.”</p>
                <img src="newsimg\image16.jpg">
                <p>The tweet appeared multiple times in sort of a cat-and-mouse game, 
                    with Twitter deleting the initial one just a few minutes after it was posted, only for it to be posted again.</p>
                <p>“Confirming the accounts were hacked through a third-party platform,” a Twitter spokesperson said. 
                    “As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we locked the compromised accounts and are working closely with our partners at Facebook to restore them.”

                    According to the tweet, the third-party platform used may have been Khoros, a social media management site.
                    
                    We’ve reached out to both Facebook and OurMine for comment and will update this story when we hear back from them.
                    
                    OurMine, a hacker group made up of five members, primarily focuses on network security. 
                    They’ve previously hacked accounts of celebrities, NFL players, and tech CEOs including Twitter’s own Jack Dorsey —
                     whose account was also compromised this past November by a different hacker group.</p>
